The bar is still a little rough, but we have

1. a functioning status bar (waybar)
2. icons showing 'active' workspaces
3. hyprpicker working (not part of videos; not assigned to a keybind)
4. swww works, but is not hard-coded into config (also not part of videos)
5. Notifications via swaync. Not crazy about looks, but it works with screenshots below.
5. Screenshot (hyprshot) functionality, both window (PrtSc) and region (SHIFT+PrtSrc)

Passed on the `hypridle` and `hyprlock` passages.
